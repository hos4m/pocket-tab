# PocketTab

#### What is this?
A playground to create a basic interface for [Pocket](https://getpocket.com).

#### Why am I doing it?
Experimenting with new stuff and technologies like:
- [Alpine.js](https://github.com/alpinejs/alpine)
- [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- Writing web apps without a full-fledged JavaScript framework
- Loading partial HTML files, you can check how this is done by reading `/utils/includeHTML.js`, `/partisl` and `index.html`

### What have I learnt?
- Building web apps using near plain JavaScript is not that hard as assumed if you first think well about the architecture of your app and where every module will live
- `tailwindcss` is actually not that bad, I was always stubrn towards this kind of frameworks because I had this impression that it will pollute the HTML and makes it hard to read. What I found out from this small experiment that it was actually fun to work with and made me code common UI elements faster without thinking too much about CSS
- `Alpinejs` is a great example of how a front-end framework can be minimal and effecient at the same time. I was able to do most of the basic tasks I can do with React just with so little of `Alpinejs`
- `Alpinejs` gives your HTML and JavaScript a little bit of magic but not that much that it becomes overwhelming. It was easy to look into Alpinejs's source code and learn from it some cool tricks like [Proxy in JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy)
